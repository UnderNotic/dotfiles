# Shortcuts

## Navigating
* `ALT + C` &nbsp; cd into dir, which is under current dir (show all dirs)
* `CTRL + T` &nbsp; paste file name into cli, which is under current dir (show all files)
* `CTRL + G` &nbsp; paste dir into cli from fasd list
* `CTRL + E` &nbsp; paste file name into cli from fasd list
* `CTRL + E within fzf list`&nbsp; open file/dir in code from fzf list in code
* `CTRL + O  within fzf list` &nbsp; open file/dir with xdg-open from fzf list in code
* `CTRL + R` &nbsp; use command from past
* `z` &nbsp; navigate using z
* `e` &nbsp; open file in code using z
* `o` &nbsp; open file/dir in xdg-open using z

## Utils
* `xd` &nbsp; open with xdg-open, can open dirs with nemo
* `htop` &nbsp; process util
* `glances` &nbsp; more advanced process util
* `df` &nbsp; show free disk space
* `ncdu` &nbsp; disk space usage tool
* `jq` &nbsp; json traverser
* `http` &nbsp; rest calls
* `fd` &nbsp; better find
* `rg` &nbsp; regex utils
* `fzf` &nbsp; text finder
* `fuck` &nbsp; fix last misspelled command
* `regexgen [strings]` &nbsp; generate regex from give strings
* `extract` &nbsp; extract all-in-one tool

## MC
* `ALT + S` &nbsp; find by string in current dir
* `CTRL + T` &nbsp; select item
* \* &nbsp; reverse selection. If nothing was selected, all files will get selected.
* `Alt + ,` &nbsp; switch mc’s layout from left-right to top-bottom
* `Alt + i` &nbsp; synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show the current directory in the other panel.
* `Alt + t` &nbsp; switch the panel’s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long, user-defined. “long” is especially useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.
* `Alt + ?` &nbsp; shows the full Find dialog.
* `Ctrl + x s` &nbsp; (that is press Ctrl + x, let it go and then press s) - create a symbolic link (change s to l for a hardlink). I find it very useful and intuitive - the link will, of course, be created in the other panel. You can change it’s destination and name, like with any other file operation.
* `Alt + Shift + h` &nbsp; show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate than going back one entry at a time.

## LF 
* `Ctrl + f` &nbsp; open/close LF
* `space` &nbsp; toggle select
* `v` &nbsp; invert select
* `y` &nbsp; copy selected
* `d` &nbsp; cut selected
* `p` &nbsp; paste selected
* `i` &nbsp; preview
* `f` &nbsp; fzf go to selected file, which is under current dir
* `c` &nbsp; fzf go to selected dir, which is under current dir
* `z` &nbsp; use z
* `gh` &nbsp; go to home dir
